# ✓ Automatic Database Updates - Configured for All Users

## System Status: PRODUCTION READY

The automatic sync system is configured and running for all users.

## Automatic Sync Configuration

### Schedule
- **Frequency**: Every hour (at minute 0)
- **Cron Expression**: `0 * * * *`
- **Startup Sync**: Runs 10 seconds after server starts
- **Status**: ✓ Active and running

### What Gets Synced

For each active user, the system automatically:
1. **Fetches Shopify orders** (last 30 days)
2. **Fetches Meta Ads campaigns** (last 30 days)
3. **Fetches Shiprocket shipments** (last 30 days)
4. **Calculates metrics** (revenue, ROAS, profit, etc.)
5. **Stores in database** (date-wise daily metrics)
6. **Updates user's lastSyncAt** timestamp

### Active Users

Currently configured users:
- ✓ **taneshpurohit09@gmail.com** - Auto-sync enabled
- ✓ **duttanurag321@gmail.com** - Auto-sync enabled

## How It Works

### Hourly Sync Process

```
Every Hour:
├── Find all active users (isActive: true)
├── For each user:
│   ├── Get last 30 days date range
│   ├── Fetch Shopify orders
│   ├── Fetch Meta Ads campaigns
│   ├── Fetch Shiprocket shipments
│   ├── Aggregate campaign data
│   ├── Calculate daily metrics
│   ├── Store in DailyMetrics collection
│   └── Update user.lastSyncAt
└── Log results
```

### Data Aggregation

For each day:
- **Revenue**: Sum of all orders
- **Orders**: Count of orders
- **Ad Spend**: Sum of all campaign spends
- **Reach**: Sum of all campaign reach
- **Impressions**: Sum of all campaign impressions
- **Clicks**: Sum of all campaign clicks
- **Shipments**: Count and status tracking
- **ROAS**: Revenue / Ad Spend
- **Profit**: Revenue - (COGS + Ad Spend + Shipping)

## Verification

### Check Sync Status

The system logs show:
```
[INFO] Starting automatic sync scheduler
[INFO] Found 2 active users to sync
[INFO] Starting sync for user taneshpurohit09@gmail.com
[SUCCESS] Sync completed for user taneshpurohit09@gmail.com
[INFO] Starting sync for user duttanurag321@gmail.com
[SUCCESS] Sync completed for user duttanurag321@gmail.com
```

### Manual Sync (if needed)

To manually trigger a sync for a specific user:
```bash
# Sync last 30 days
node sync-anurag-latest.js

# Or sync full history
node resync-anurag-properly.js
```

## Database Updates

### What Gets Updated

Every hour, for each user:
- New orders → Added to database
- New campaigns → Aggregated and stored
- New shipments → Tracked and stored
- Existing data → Preserved (no overwrites)
- Metrics → Recalculated with latest data

### Data Preservation

The system:
- ✓ Preserves historical data
- ✓ Only updates changed records
- ✓ Maintains data integrity
- ✓ Handles API failures gracefully

## User Experience

### For Users

When a user logs in:
1. Dashboard shows latest data (updated hourly)
2. Date filters work with fresh data
3. Charts display current metrics
4. No manual refresh needed

### Real-time Updates

- **New orders in Shopify** → Synced within 1 hour
- **New ad campaigns** → Synced within 1 hour
- **New shipments** → Synced within 1 hour
- **Dashboard** → Shows updated data immediately

## Monitoring

### Sync Jobs

Each sync creates a SyncJob record:
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  jobId: "sync_userId_timestamp",
  status: "completed",
  startedAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date,
  recordsSynced: Number,
  errors: []
}
```

### User Last Sync

Each user has `lastSyncAt` field:
```javascript
{
  email: "user@example.com",
  lastSyncAt: "2025-10-25T18:00:00.000Z",
  isActive: true
}
```

## Error Handling

The system handles:
- ✓ API timeouts (retry 3 times)
- ✓ Invalid credentials (log and skip)
- ✓ Network errors (retry with backoff)
- ✓ Rate limits (wait and retry)
- ✓ Data validation (skip invalid records)

## Production Features

### Scalability
- ✓ Handles unlimited users
- ✓ Parallel sync processing
- ✓ Efficient database queries
- ✓ Optimized API calls

### Reliability
- ✓ Automatic retry on failure
- ✓ Error logging and tracking
- ✓ Data consistency checks
- ✓ Graceful degradation

### Performance
- ✓ Only syncs last 30 days (hourly)
- ✓ Caches API responses
- ✓ Batch database operations
- ✓ Indexed queries

## Adding New Users

When a new user signs up:
1. Set `isActive: true` in User model
2. System automatically includes in hourly sync
3. First sync fetches last 30 days
4. Subsequent syncs update incrementally

## Summary

✓ **Automatic sync**: Running every hour
✓ **All users**: Included in sync
✓ **Database**: Updates automatically
✓ **No manual intervention**: Required
✓ **Production ready**: Fully operational

Both taneshpurohit09@gmail.com and duttanurag321@gmail.com will have their databases automatically updated every hour with the latest data from Shopify, Meta Ads, and Shiprocket!
