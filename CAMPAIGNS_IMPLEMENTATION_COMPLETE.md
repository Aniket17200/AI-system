# ✅ Individual Campaigns Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully implemented individual campaign tracking from Meta Ads API with numbered campaign names for the Marketing Dashboard.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File**: `models/DailyMetrics.js`

Added campaigns array to store individual campaign data:
```javascript
campaigns: [{
  campaignId: String,
  campaignName: String,
  spend: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  reach: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  impressions: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  clicks: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  cpc: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  cpm: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  ctr: { type: Number, default: 0 }
}]
```

### 2. Data Sync Service Update
**File**: `services/dataSyncService.js`

Enhanced to fetch individual campaigns:
- Fetches all campaigns from Meta Ads API
- Gets insights for each campaign individually
- Groups campaign data by date
- Stores campaigns array in daily metrics

**Key Changes**:
- Added `getCampaigns()` call to fetch campaign list
- Added `getCampaignInsights()` for each campaign
- Updated `groupByDate()` to include campaigns
- Updated `calculateDailyMetrics()` to return campaigns array

### 3. API Endpoint Update
**File**: `routes/dataRoutes.js`

Updated `/api/data/marketingData` endpoint:
- Aggregates campaigns across all days in date range
- Calculates metrics for each campaign (CPC, CPM, CTR, ROAS)
- Returns campaigns with numbered names: "Campaign 1", "Campaign 2", etc.
- Includes `originalName` field for reference

**Response Format**:
```javascript
{
  campaigns: [
    {
      campaignName: "Campaign 1",
      originalName: "Bvlgari New Video 13-10-25",
      amountSpent: 11901.18,
      impressions: 121057,
      cpm: "98.31",
      ctr: "4.06%",
      clicks: 4915,
      cpc: "2.42",
      sales: "0.00",
      cps: "0.00",
      roas: "0.00",
      totalSales: "0.00"
    },
    // ... more campaigns
  ]
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Sync Process**:
   ```
   Meta Ads API → getCampaigns() → Get campaign list
                → getCampaignInsights() → Get metrics per campaign
                → Group by date → Store in DailyMetrics
   ```

2. **API Request**:
   ```
   GET /api/data/marketingData?startDate=2025-07-27&endDate=2025-07-27
   → Fetch DailyMetrics with campaigns
   → Aggregate campaigns across dates
   → Calculate metrics per campaign
   → Return numbered campaigns array
   ```

3. **Frontend Display**:
   ```
   Frontend → API call → Receive campaigns array
           → Display as "Campaign 1", "Campaign 2", etc.
           → Show all 10 metrics per campaign
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scripts Created

2. **test-campaigns-complete.js** - Complete API and database test
3. **test-campaign-names.js** - Verifies numbered campaign names
4. **check-campaign-dates.js** - Checks which dates have campaigns

### Test Results
```bash
✅ API Endpoint: Working
✅ Campaigns Returned: 59
