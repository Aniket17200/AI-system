# ✅ Campaign Selection - FIXED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Table Rows Not Clickable
**Before**: Clicking on campaigns in the Detailed Analysis table did nothing

**After**: 
- Table rows are now clickable
- Hover effect shows which row you're hovering over
- Selected campaign is highlighted with background color
- Click handler logs and updates selected campaign

### 2. Better Debugging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Which campaign is selected
- Whether campaign data is found
- What metrics are being displayed
- Bar chart clicks
- Table row clicks

### 3. Campaign Data Loading
Improved campaign data handling:
- Properly finds campaign from campaigns array
- Falls back to campaignMetrics if needed
- Logs available campaigns on data load
- Shows first 5 campaign names in console

## Code Changes

### 1. Added Click Handler to Table Rows
```javascript
<tr 
  className={`border-t border-gray-700 cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors ${
    selectedCampaign === campaign.campaignName ? 'bg-gray-800' : ''
  }`}
  onClick={() => {
    console.log("Table row clicked:", campaign.campaignName);
    setSelectedCampaign(campaign.campaignName);
  }}
>
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedCampaign) {
    console.log("Selected campaign:", selectedCampaign);
    console.log("Campaign data found:", !!selectedCampaignData);
    console.log("Metrics:", metrics);
  }
}, [selectedCampaign, selectedCampaignData, metrics]);
```

### 3. Enhanced Bar Click Handler
```javascript
const handleBarClick = (data) => {
  console.log("Bar clicked:", data.name);
  const campaignExists = campaigns.some(c => c.campaignName === data.name) || metaCampaignMetrics[data.name];
  console.log("Campaign exists:", campaignExists);
  if (campaignExists) {
    console.log("Setting selected campaign to:", data.name);
    setSelectedCampaign(data.name);
  } else {
    console.warn("Campaign not found:", data.name);
  }
};
```
