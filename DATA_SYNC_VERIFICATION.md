### Data Sources Status

#### 1. Shopify API ✅

Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Net Profit = Gross Profit - Ad Spend - Shipping Cost
```

#### New Formula (in API):
```javascript
COGS = Revenue / 2
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Net Profit = Revenue - (COGS + Ad Spend + Shipping Cost)
```

### Issues Found

1. **Recent Meta Ads Data Missing** ⚠️
   - Last 3 days show 0 ad spend
   - Need to run manual sync
   - Or wait for auto-sync to catch up

2. **COGS Calculation Changed** ℹ️
   - Old: Based on actual product costs
   - New: Revenue / 2 (as per your requirement)
   - This is intentional per your formula

3. **Date Range Discrepancy** ℹ️
   - Database shows 32 days of data
   - Some days might have partial data
   - Auto-sync fills in missing days

### Recommendations

#### 1. Run Manual Sync for Recent Days
```bash
# Via API
POST /api/sync/manual
{
  "userId": "68c812b0afc4892c1f8128e3",
  "startDate": "2025-10-23",
  "endDate": "2025-10-25"
}
```

#### 2. Check Meta Ads Token
- Verify Meta access token is valid
- Check ad account permissions
- Ensure ad account ID is correct

#### 3. Monitor Auto-Sync
- Auto-sync runs every 30 minutes
- Check logs for sync errors
- Verify all APIs are accessible
