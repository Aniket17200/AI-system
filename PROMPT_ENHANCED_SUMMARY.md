✅ Emphasized that AI HAS complete data  
✅ Added specific answer format examples  
✅ Reduced temperature for more precise responses

2. NEVER say "data is not available" if the metric is shown
3. When asked about a time period (30/60/90 days), use EXACT period data

```

### 3. Response Format Rules
